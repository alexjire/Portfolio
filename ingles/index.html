                    <p>The ancient Egyptians used a writing system called hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs were made up of symbols and pictures, each representing sounds, words, or ideas. They were carved on temple walls, tombs, and monuments, and written on papyrus. Writing was mainly used by priests and scribes for religious texts, official records, and keeping history. It played a very important role in preserving the culture and knowledge of ancient Egypt.</p>

                        Over time, the Old Kingdom became weaker because of fights and changes in the government.<br>
                        People stopped using the pyramids the same way, and some were looted.<br>
                        Later, other countries, like the Assyrians, Persians, and Greeks, invaded Egypt.<br>
                        Weak rulers and money problems also made the kingdom weaker.<br>
                        Finally, Egypt became part of other empires.<br>
                        Even today, the culture, buildings, and knowledge of ancient Egypt are very important and admired around the world.
